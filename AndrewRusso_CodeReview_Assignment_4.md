I think it was smart for you to make a class for the data grind and to get this info. This should make it easier to use this data in this program if you need to make more forms. It could help to make the methods that sort the data or search it be in the library, if you make it universal enough, other programs might be able to use it as well. I struggled with coming up with what to have this library do, and even just making it. It was a lot easier after I finished the program or had a much better idea how it was going to behave to make the library.
